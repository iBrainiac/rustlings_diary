# Rustlings Exercises Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Rustlings exercises. Rustlings is an excellent collection of exercises designed to help you learn Rust by solving small coding problems.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress as I work through the Rustlings exercises. Each section contains different exercises that help to understand and practice various concepts in Rust.

## Sections
## So far, i have solved the following sections:

1. **Variables**
    - Understanding variable declaration, type annotations, mutable variables, shadowing, and constants.

2. **Functions**
    - Learning function definitions, parameters, return types, and how to use expressions and statements.



## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**:
   
    git clone https://github.com/Nelly-Njeri/RustlingsSolutions.git

    cd Rustlings-Solutions

2. **Navigate to the topic folder** you are interested in:
   
    cd variables
   

3. **Open and review the exercise solutions**
