# Functions Section Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to the functions section of the Rustlings exercises. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of function usage in Rust.

## Exercises

### functions1.rs
- **Learned**: Basic function definition and calling.
- **Key Points**: Declaring functions and invoking them from the `main` function.

### functions2.rs
- **Learned**: Function parameters and type annotations.
- **Key Points**: Defining parameters with explicit types and using them in function calls.


### functions3.rs
- **Learned**: Passing arguments to functions.
- **Key Points**: Correctly calling functions with arguments and ensuring type compatibility.


### functions4.rs
- **Learned**: Function signatures, conditional logic, and calling functions within functions.
- **Key Points**: Using return types, conditional statements, and nested function calls.

### functions5.rs
- **Learned**: Differentiating between expressions and statements.
- **Key Points**: Ensuring the last line in a function is an expression to return a value without using the `return` keyword

## Overview

Through these exercises, I gained a deeper understanding of how to define and use functions in Rust, handle parameters and return types, and implement conditional logic within functions. Each exercise built upon the previous, reinforcing key concepts and best practices in Rust programming.
