// In this exercise, I learned about:

// Character Type (char): How to use character literals in Rust.
// Character Methods: Using methods like .is_alphabetic() and .is_numeric() to check the type of characters.
// The methods .is_alphabetic() and .is_numeric() are built-in methods provided by the Rust standard library for the char type. 
// These methods are part of Rust's comprehensive standard library, which includes many utility functions for various data types.
// Learned about character type (`char`) in Rust
// - Used character methods to check if a character is alphabetic or numeric
// - Practiced working with different types of characters, including emojis
