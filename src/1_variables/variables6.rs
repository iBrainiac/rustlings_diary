// in this exercise, i learnt about constants and that one must always annotate the type.
// Hereâ€™s an example of a constant declaration:

// const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
// also learnt about Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants 
// is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.
