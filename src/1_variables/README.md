# Rustlings Variables Section Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Rustlings variables section. Below is a summary of the exercises and what I learned from each.

### Variables

In Rust, variables are immutable by default.
When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you canâ€™t change that value.
You can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name.

### Exercises

### variables1.rs

## What I Learned
- Declaring and initializing variables in Rust.
- Using `println!` macro for output.

### variables2.rs

##What I Learned:
- Basic conditional statements (`if-else`) in Rust.
- Variable initialization and comparison.

### variables3.rs

## What I Learned:
- Type annotation for variables.
- Declaring and initializing variables with specific types.

### variables4.rs

## What I Learned:
- Mutable variables using `mut`.
- Changing the value of a mutable variable.

### variables5.rs

## What I Learned:
- Shadowing: re-declaring variables with the same name but different types.
- Using shadowing for transformations while keeping variables immutable.

### variables6.rs

## What I Learned:
- Declaring constants with `const`.
- Constants require type annotations and follow Rust's naming convention (uppercase with underscores).

These exercises provided a solid foundation in variable management, type annotations, conditionals, and constants in Rust. On to the next section! ðŸš€
