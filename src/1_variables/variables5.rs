fn main() {
    let number = "T-H-R-E-E"; // don't change this line
    println!("Spell a Number : {}", number);
    let number = 3; // don't rename this variable
    println!("Number plus two is : {}", number + 2);
}
// In this exercise I learnt about Shadowing. 
// I re-declared 'number' with the same name, but as an integer.
// This program first binds 'number' to a value of "T-H-R-E-E"  
// and then it creates a new variable 'number' by repeating let 'number' =3;
//  By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value 
// but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
// Onto the next!!ðŸ”¥
